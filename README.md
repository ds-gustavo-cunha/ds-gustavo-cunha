<br>
Who am I? 
<br>I am a self-disciplined, resilient, and ethical person.
<br>I have a military background and has a curious and active mind.
<br>Recently, I fell in love with data science and, since then, I've been focusing my energy and time on learning skills required to become a data scientist.
<br>
<br>
What are my personal life achievements and previous experiences?
<br>I was the first rank at the Brazilian Naval Academy admission process in 2011.
<br>I joined the Brazilian Naval Academy as an aspirant in 2012 and quit the Brazilian Navy as a second lieutenant in 2017. <br>As a naval military, I made missions to many states in Brazil and 16 countries (South America, Africa, Europe, North America, Central America).
<br>I passed the academic and the physical exams of the Brazilian Federal Police and the Brazilian Federal Highway Police admission processes in 2021 (both of them with more than 300,000 candidates).
<br>
<br>
In the short term, I want to get a junior data scientist job.

## Data Science Projects:

### [Health Insurance Cross-Sell]( https://github.com/ds-gustavo-cunha/pa004_health_insurance_cross_sell )
Insurance All is a health insurance company and its products team is analyzing the possibility of offering a new product, automobile insurance, for its health insurance clients. Similar to its health insurance, customers of this new insurance plan would have to pay an annual plan to be insured by Insurance All in case of an eventual car accident or damage. In this project, I developed a Machine Learning algorithm that increases the number of contacted interested customers by 1,316 and 2,259 for 20,000 and 40,000 sales teams contacts so that the estimated revenue increases are respectively U$ 131,600 and U$ 235,900.
