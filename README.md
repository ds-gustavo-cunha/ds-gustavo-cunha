Hello! üôÇ

First of all, thanks for reading this üòä. On the following lines, I will try to give you a few 'bytes' of me.

<br>
<strong>Who is Gustavo?</strong> üò¨

* He is a self-disciplined, resilient, and ethical person. 

* He has a military background and has a curious and active mind.

* Recently, he fell in love with data science and, since then, he's been focusing his energy and time on learning skills required to become a data scientist.

<br>
<strong>What are his achievements and his previous experiences?</strong> üèÜ

* He was the first rank at the Brazilian Naval Academy admission process in 2011.

* He joined the Brazilian Naval Academy as an aspirant in 2012 and quit the Brazilian Navy as a second lieutenant in 2017. These five years (and a few months) were very intense and challenging for him, especially regarding military routine and academic exams. However, due to all of these challenges he had to overcome, these years were undoubtedly very maturing for him. As a naval military, he also had the opportunity to embark on Brazilian naval vessels that made missions to many states in Brazil and 16 countries (South America, Africa, Europe, North America, Central America).

* In 2017, he decided to quit the Navy and took a break, investing his time and energy on one personal project. 

* He passed the academic and the physical exams of the Brazilian Federal Police and the Brazilian Federal Highway Police admission processes in 2021 (both of them with more than 300,000 candidates).

* Finally, since June 2021, he's been studying computer science and data science to become a data scientist soon.

<br>
<strong>What are the analytical tools he uses in his projects?</strong> üõ†

* **Data Collect and Storage:** SQL, SQLite, MySQL, Postgres.

* **Data Processing and Analysis:** Python.

* **Development:** Git, Linux.

* **Machine Learning Modeling:** Classification, Regression, Time Series, Clustering.

* **Machine Learning Deployment:** Heroku, AWS, Google Sheets, Telegram, Streamlit.

* **Data Visualization:** Metabase.

## Data Science Projects:

### [Insiders Project]( https://github.com/ds-gustavo-cunha/Insiders-Project )
The All in One Place company is a multi-brand outlet company that sells second-line products of several brands at a lower price through e-commerce. Within just one year of operation, the marketing team realized that some customers buy more expensive products with high frequency and contribute to a significant portion of the company's revenue. This project aims to determine who are the customers eligible to participate in the Insiders program. Once this list is ready, the Marketing team will carry out a sequence of personalized and exclusive actions to this group of people to increase their sales and purchase frequency. The final solution answers business questions, validate business hypotheses, create a reporting dashboard and implement a solution architecture in AWS cloud.

### [Rossmann Store Sales]( https://github.com/ds-gustavo-cunha/Rossmann-Store-Sales )
Rossmann is a company that operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Its products range includes up to 21,700 items and can vary depending on the size of the shop and the location. Rossmann store managers need daily sales predictions for up to six weeks in advance so as to plan infrastructure investments in their stores (will next six weeks sales be high enough to balance infrastructure investment?). The final solution for this problem is a Telegram bot where the user just needs to type the number of the store and the bot will quickly answer the sales prediction for this given store in the next six weeks. Besides, if the final user wants more detailed information about this six weeks prediction, he (she) could get further details on a data App, with an interactive chart, on sales prediction over these six weeks. Furthermore, on this data App, the user can also read the entire project overview to understand further how this prediction is made.

### [Health Insurance Cross-Sell]( https://github.com/ds-gustavo-cunha/pa004_health_insurance_cross_sell )
Insurance All is a health insurance company and its products team is analyzing the possibility of offering a new product, automobile insurance, for its health insurance clients. Similar to its health insurance, customers of this new insurance plan would have to pay an annual plan to be insured by Insurance All in case of an eventual car accident or damage. In this project, I developed a Machine Learning algorithm that increases the number of contacted interested customers by 1,316 and 2,259 for 20,000 and 40,000 sales teams contacts so that the estimated revenue increases are respectively U$ 131,600 and U$ 225,900.
